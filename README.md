# CoolCrawler
CoolCrawler scrapes email addresses from a domain, just run it and enter a domain (ie 'mit.edu').

## To Run
CoolCrawler uses Selenium Webdriver:
- To pull dependencies install Maven then open terminal and go to project home directory, type "mvn clean install"
- If you are using eclipse make sure you type "mvn eclipse:eclipse" so you can import as a java project
- Currently CoolCrawler is setup to use FireFox, you can change to a different browser in the constructor
